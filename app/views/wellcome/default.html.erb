	<h3>Welcome to the <em>in silico</em> wheat Target Induced Local Lesions In Genome (TILLING) website</h3>

	<p>This resource consists of TILLING populations developed in tetraploid durum wheat cv 'Kronos' and hexaploid bread wheat cv 'Cadenza' as part of a joint project between the University of California Davis, Rothamsted Research, The Earlham Institute, and John Innes Centre.</p>

	<p>We have re-sequenced the exome sequence of &gt;1,000 Kronos and &gt;600 Cadenza mutants using Illumina next-generation sequencing, aligned this raw data to the IWGSC Chinese Spring chromosome arm survey sequence, identified mutations, and predicted their effects based on the protein annotation available at Ensembl Plants.</p>
